# Next Order Predictor using LSTM

# Overview

The Next Order Predictor project is an end-to-end sequence prediction system designed to forecast the next item in a sequence. It utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to handle sequential data and provide accurate predictions. This project integrates advanced machine learning techniques and a streamlined workflow to deliver precise results.

# Key Features

Sequence-Based Predictions: Leverages LSTM networks to analyze time-series data and predict the next sequence element, ensuring high accuracy.

Customizable Dataset Support: Easily adaptable to various datasets with minimal preprocessing effort.

Data Science-Driven Backend: Employs robust data processing, feature extraction, and model training techniques for efficient prediction.

Visualization Tools: Includes scripts for comparing predictions with ground truth, aiding in performance evaluation and insights.

# Workflow

Data Preparation: Input data is preprocessed and normalized to suit the LSTM model requirements.

Model Training: The LSTM model is trained on prepared data to learn sequence patterns.

Prediction and Evaluation: The trained model predicts the next sequence elements, which are then evaluated against actual data.

Visualization: Predictions are visualized to showcase alignment with the true sequence, providing intuitive feedback.
